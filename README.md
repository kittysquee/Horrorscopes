# Horrorscopes

This is the code for the [first website](http://spookyhoroscopes.com/) I ever made. 
Although it is only a small two page website I learned many important lessons from making this website. 

I learned some basic HTML:
* The difference between block and inline elements
* How to add links 
* Basic drop downs and buttons 
* The importance of using different header types

I also learned some basic CSS:
* How to include it in my website by linking it to the HTML
* I learned a little about the different colour codes
* Setting fonts and default fonts for different machines
* Doing nice things like rounding off buttons

I also learned how to include the Facebook and Twitter share buttons (it was a pain in the ass to line them up but I got there eventually!) 

To steal and mangle a quote from Lilo and Stitch:
>This is my first website. I made it, all on my own. It's little, and simple, but still good. Yeah, still good.
